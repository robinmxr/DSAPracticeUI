The choice of traversal method affects algorithm efficiency and the order in which operations are performed on elements."
  },
  "Reversal": {

Merging can be applied to arrays, linked lists, and is essential for external sorting algorithms when data doesn't fit in memory."
  },
  "Cycle detection": {
    description: "Algorithms designed to determine whether a cycle exists within a data structure, meaning there's a path that starts and ends at the same node. In linked lists, a cycle occurs when a node's next pointer points to a previously visited node.

    description: "Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the 'tortoise and hare' algorithm, is an elegant pointer algorithm that detects cycles in a sequence of values using only O(1) space. It employs two pointers moving at different speeds: if there's a cycle, they will eventually meet inside the cycle.

This technique extends beyond linked lists to any sequence where you can define a 'next' function, making it applicable to various mathematical and computational problems."
  },
  "Two Pass": {
    description: "An algorithmic approach where the data structure is processed twice to solve a problem, with each pass serving a specific purpose. The first pass typically gathers information (like counting elements, finding length, or identifying key positions), while the second pass performs the actual operation using the information from the first pass. This technique is common in linked list problems where you need to know the length beforehand, or in array problems where you need to understand the overall data distribution before processing."
  },
  "Multiple Steps": {
    description: "A problem-solving approach that breaks complex problems into several distinct, sequential phases where each phase has a specific responsibility and the output of one phase becomes the input for the next. This methodology makes complex problems manageable by isolating concerns and allows for easier debugging and testing. Examples include: finding the middle of a linked list, reversing the second half, and then merging; or building a graph representation, performing DFS, and then analyzing results. Each step should have a clear, single responsibility."

  },
  "Iterative/Recursive": {
    description: "Two fundamental programming paradigms for solving problems. Iterative solutions use loops (for, while) to repeat operations, maintaining state in variables and explicitly controlling the flow. Recursive solutions break problems into smaller instances of the same problem, using function calls and the call stack to manage state. Each approach has trade-offs: iteration typically uses constant stack space but may require more complex state management, while recursion often leads to cleaner code but uses O(n) stack space and may hit stack overflow limits for large inputs."
  },
  "Iterative Reversal": {
    description: "The process of reversing a data structure using iterative methods (loops) rather than recursion. In linked list reversal, this involves maintaining three pointers (previous, current, next) and iteratively changing the direction of links.

  "Divide & Conquer": {
    description: "A fundamental algorithmic paradigm that recursively breaks down problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems of the same type, solves them independently, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem. The approach typically has three steps: divide (break the problem), conquer (solve subproblems recursively), and combine (merge solutions). Classic examples include merge sort, quicksort, and binary search.

    description: "Two fundamental data access patterns that define how elements are added and removed from data structures. LIFO (Last In, First Out) describes stack behavior where the most recently added element is the first to be removed, like a stack of plates. FIFO (First In, First Out) describes queue behavior where the first element added is the first to be removed, like a line of people. Understanding these patterns is crucial for choosing appropriate data structures and for problems involving order dependencies, scheduling, and resource management."
  },
  "Monotonic Stack": {
    description: "A stack data structure where elements are maintained in a specific monotonic order - either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing from bottom to top. When a new element violates the monotonic property, elements are popped from the stack until the property is restored. Monotonic stacks are powerful for solving problems involving finding the next greater/smaller element, calculating areas in histograms, and solving range queries. They often transform O(n²) brute force solutions into efficient O(n) algorithms by avoiding redundant comparisons."
  },
  "Queue with stacks": {
    description: "A technique for implementing a queue's FIFO behavior using two stacks (which have LIFO behavior). One stack (input) handles enqueue operations, while the other (output) handles dequeue operations. When dequeuing from an empty output stack, all elements from the input stack are transferred to the output stack, reversing their order and achieving FIFO behavior. This implementation provides amortized O(1) time complexity for both operations and demonstrates how different data structures can be combined to achieve desired behaviors."

  "Path problems": {
    description: "A category of tree and graph problems that involve finding paths between nodes that satisfy specific conditions or optimize certain criteria. Examples include finding the maximum sum path, longest path, paths with specific properties, or all paths between two nodes.

  "In-order": {
    description: "A depth-first tree traversal method that visits nodes in the order: left subtree, root node, right subtree. For binary search trees, in-order traversal produces elements in ascending sorted order, making it particularly useful for problems requiring sorted processing of BST elements. In-order traversal can be implemented recursively (using call stack) or iteratively (using explicit stack). This traversal pattern is essential for BST validation, finding kth smallest elements, and converting BSTs to sorted arrays or other structures."
  },
  "Recursion": {
    description: "A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem, eventually reaching a base case that stops the recursion. Recursion is natural for problems with recursive structure like trees, fractals, and divide-and-conquer algorithms. Every recursive solution needs: base case(s) to terminate recursion, recursive case(s) that make progress toward the base case, and proper parameter passing. While recursion can make code more elegant and easier to understand, it uses stack space proportional to the recursion depth and can lead to stack overflow for deep recursions."

  "Memoization": {
    description: "A top-down dynamic programming optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns cached results when the same inputs occur again. Memoization transforms recursive algorithms with overlapping subproblems from exponential to polynomial time complexity.

The technique is particularly effective for problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, such as Fibonacci calculation, longest common subsequence, and many optimization problems. Memoization preserves the natural recursive structure while adding efficiency."
  },
  "Tabulation": {
    description: "A bottom-up dynamic programming approach where solutions are built iteratively from the smallest subproblems up to the target problem, typically using arrays or tables to store intermediate results. Unlike memoization, tabulation avoids recursion and builds solutions systematically from base cases.

Examples include knapsack problems, coin change, and path problems with multiple routes."
  },
  "Unbounded Knapsack": {
    description: "A variation of the classic knapsack problem where items can be selected multiple times (unlimited quantity of each item), as opposed to the 0/1 knapsack where each item can be taken at most once. The DP approach differs in that when considering an item, you don't move to the next item but can consider the same item again. This leads to different recurrence relations and iterative patterns. Unbounded knapsack models problems like coin change (unlimited coins of each denomination) and resource allocation with renewable resources."
  },
  "State Tracking": {
    description: "Dynamic programming technique where the optimal solution depends not just on the current position but also on additional state information carried from previous steps. This might include tracking the maximum/minimum value seen so far, the previous choice made, parity conditions, or other problem-specific state. State tracking expands the DP state space beyond simple position-based indexing and requires careful consideration of what information is necessary to make optimal decisions at each step."

  "Top K problems": {
    description: "A category of problems requiring finding the k largest, smallest, most frequent, or otherwise ranked elements from a collection. These problems often use heaps to maintain the top k elements efficiently without sorting the entire collection. Two main approaches: use a min-heap of size k for finding k largest elements, or max-heap of size k for k smallest elements. Top K problems teach important concepts about space-time tradeoffs and are common in data analysis, recommendation systems, and real-time analytics applications."

  "Merge operations": {
    description: "The fundamental process of combining multiple sorted data structures (arrays, lists, streams) into a single sorted output while maintaining the sorted property. Merge operations are the building blocks of merge sort and are used in many divide-and-conquer algorithms. The basic algorithm uses multiple pointers to compare elements from input sources and selects the smallest (or largest) at each step. Advanced merge operations handle k-way merges and are crucial for distributed computing and database operations."
